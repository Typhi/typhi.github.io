    <p>Context: Discussion in a Game Production community about how to foster more open feedback within a team.</p>


    <strong>Starting with the onboarding talks</strong>, establish an open and casual atmosphere.
    This is a great opportunity to establish a basic relationship and lines of communication between
    the new team member and the game design team, as well as the new team member and the product manager / producer,
    since these are traditionally roles that can easily accidentally end up blocking themselves off from critical feedback,
    or tacitly discouraging it.


    <ul>
        <li>

            Example form this can take: Have the lead GD give the rundown on the game to the new team member,
            explain the vision, explain some of the parts they're happy with, what they find particularly challenging,
            and encourage them to approach with questions or comments.

        </li>
        <li>

            Example 2: Have Prod person introduce the person to the high-level processes (including roadmapping)
            and encourage them to approach someone with the stuff they think is weird in their first weeks, along with the reasoning:
            Maybe they'll be missing some info, and then can be corrected. Or maybe we're doing something terrible,
            and they can assist us with their unsullied eyes! (Shout-out for this blog post on that topic:
            <a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="inline" href="https://danluu.com/wat/" rel="nofollow">https://danluu.com/wat/</a> )

        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Have a clear vision, ensure that the current priorities for the game are established</strong>,
        and relentlessly communicate both of these, or suffer the consequences on the feedback front (among others).
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Knowing the vision is necessary for team members to provide relevant and specific feedback
            instead of just spouting off whatever is on their mind which may or may not be relevant.
            (Though there can also be value in that sometimes. :D)

        </li>
        <li>
            As above goes for knowing the prios, but the priorities additionally allow feedback receivers to efficiently navigate processing and actioning the feedback after receiving it. Said differently, the clear priorities support feedback receivers in answering the question of: "Should I do something with this feedback now, or later, or never?"
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Establish a team habit of showing off work to the other team members</strong>
        and requesting thoughts. This applies to all disciplines, but will take different forms for each,
        and the level of detail will also differ from context to context. One way in which this will differ depending on the context,
        is that it is valuable to ensure a whole 40-person team knows the rough outline of an upcoming feature
        (which they could for example get in a 10 minute presentation after the daily sync),
        but probably only the 8-person sub-team that is working on it directly will need the details
        (example: an hour-long breaking-down of the feature into tasks). Some examples of forms this could take:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Art has a rest-of-team-facing channel where they post stuff occasionally
        </li>
        <li>
            GD shows off high level concepts close to when you’re going to start production on them in a quick presentation after standup
        </li>
        <li>
            People implementing stuff in the game show (e.g. devs) off their finished task when it's ready to be merged to main
        </li>
        <li>
            PM walks the full team through the roadmap when it's close to solidifying but still early enough for changes if something unexpected comes up
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <strong>Provide feedback givers some sort of closure</strong>
        /useful response indicating their feedback has been considered in some way. A producer-specific example:
        don't end with "hey that's a nice idea" but rather "hey that's a nice idea but we're not gonna have time for that before soft launch because XYZ"
        or "hey that's a nice idea, I'm adding it to the list for us to discuss through when we're polishing this next week".
        The feedback givers will use your responses - or lack thereof - as a datapoint steering their future feedback,
        which can encourage or discourage it, and increase the usefulness of the exercise for everyone.
    </p>

    <p>
        Semi-related: some of the discussion I saw spawned from the original question talked about setting culture from the top,
        and that reminded me of this blog post about the role of executives which I thought was a lot of fun (if you're into that sort of thing)
