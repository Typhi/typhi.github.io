    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>Some thoughts shared with a friend about how they might want to organize their hobby game project.</p>

    <h3>Stuff I Think You'll Want to Have</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A short document describing what you're trying to accomplish.</li>
        <li>A wiki, Notion, or something to have longer-form stuff for reference.</li>
        <li>Chat + voice area where the primary communication happens.</li>
        <li>
            A centralized to-do list ordered by priority and easily grabbed from that is on the "task" level.
            <ul>
                <li>Tasks are ideally small (less than a day) as large tasks can easily go off the rails, bounded (unbounded tasks can easily go off the rails and it's hard to know when you're done), and in written form (nonsense can easily sound fine when discussed verbally, but it's harder to exist in writing).</li>
                <li>
                    Backlog/random stuff → To-do → In progress → Done.
                    <ul>
                        <li>To-do: Stuff in “to-do” is ideally ready to roll.</li>
                        <li>Don’t want a huge amount of things there, that’s overwhelming in terms of choice, prioritization, and maintenance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>What does “done” mean to your gang?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A higher-level view of what's going on that is more on a "feature" level.
            <ul>
                <li>Break those down as it becomes time to work on them.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Depending on how much everyone wants to be involved in everything, you might have a nightmare trying to get everyone online at the same time. You might want to have a pre-determined slot every [time period] where everyone's available to chat and see stuff together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some Usual Stuff That Probably Isn't Relevant</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A detailed schedule.
            <ul>
                <li>Don't really care about keeping everyone efficiently working all the time, they can just not work for a while if there's a blocker.</li>
                <li>Deadlines aren't really a thing.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Development cycles like sprints.</li>
        <li>Retrospectives.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ways You Can Be Useful to People</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Facilitating and maintaining the stuff in the "stuff you'll want to have" area above.</li>
        <li>Writing things down (e.g., meeting minutes).</li>
        <li>Seeing where there is some unclarity and forcing clarity.</li>
        <li>Running discussions.</li>
        <li>
            Keeping people focused on the currently relevant area.
            <ul>
                <li>People will be deep in their work and can easily lose sight of the bigger picture; you can assist by supplying the bigger picture.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Being available to help people with bigger picture thoughts, second opinions, or testing, etc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Other Thoughts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>People posting their progress in the chat is good. It allows others to potentially steer things if something could be even better, and it's also motivating. One way of doing this would be to have the habit of posting the result when finishing up a task.</li>
        <li>Miro is useful for all sorts of things.</li>
        <li>"Alignment" is a cool concept to keep in mind (though depending on the vibe, you might not want to use that word since it sounds buzzwordy). You don’t want people pulling in several different directions, it's inefficient and feels bad.</li>
        <li>Try to always build the smallest possible thing that does what you want or unblocks some learning. It's very easy to over-scope, especially when everyone's excited. You can always add more stuff afterward, but it's good to first have something working.</li>
        <li>Probably bias towards doing things as group activities for a long time until everyone finds their feet and understands how to work together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How I’d Start</h3>
    <p>Get a big-picture overview of what needs doing.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Break the thing into chunks, a hierarchy, and milestones.</li>
        <li>Form an opinion about which parts need doing first.</li>
        <li>(Latest here: share/discuss the big picture so far with others, if that wasn’t done already in previous steps.)</li>
        <li>Break one of the chunks into executable tasks (see above for definition of a 'task') as a group activity.</li>
        <li>Throw those tasks onto a Kanban board (maybe more than one if you separate a discipline off by itself) and start working through them.</li>
        <li>Revise the plan over time.</li>
    </ul>
