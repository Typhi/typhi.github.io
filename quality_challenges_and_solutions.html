    <p>There are a number of things that can stand in the way of good quality. Here are some of them, and the solutions we have in place for dealing with them.</p>

    <div class="table-wrap">
        <table>
            <colgroup>
                <col style="width: 196.0px;" />
                <col style="width: 654.0px;" />
            </colgroup>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th><p>Challenge</p></th>
                    <th><p>Example solutions</p></th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><p>Distance from the problems</p></td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>Have everyone working from the <strong>same base branch</strong>. If something breaks there's a good chance of it getting noticed by a colleague.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Know your game</strong>: Many team members playing the game actively as players.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Testing Dojos</strong>: Regular testing sessions with a sub-team or the entire team for bigger updates (organized by the sub-team).</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Mindset for quality</strong>: The full sub-team is responsible for the quality, because they ship it. Goes hand in hand with the QA process (QA Assistance → Developers test and demo their work), which only works if people care for quality.</p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>

                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li><p><strong>Stable main branch policy</strong>. Makes it very clear what needs to be done when there's a bug (fix it right now! it's affecting everyone!), and also makes it easier to spot real issues in the first place.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Constantly fixing bugs</strong>, no "bug fixing day". Quality should be a constant, not something to be procrastinated.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>High priority for bugs</strong> helps to maintain a low level of bugs. Note: Maintaining a certain level of quality is fairly straightforward once you've gotten there in the first place.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Sprint goals shouldn't rely on <strong>100% team utilization</strong>. Extra time for iteration, bug-fixing, and moving quickly.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Daily beta releases</strong>: Have things go live on Beta before the release train departs so that there's time for them to be fixed.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Pioneer market</strong>: We release the browser version in a single market first to catch bugs before worldwide rollout.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Pioneer platform</strong>: We release the mobile version to a percentage of our players using Google Play a day before we release everything else.</p></li>

                            <li><p>Make the current <strong>bug count transparent</strong> (in stand-ups, component syncs, retros etc.), and celebrate improvements.</p></li>
                            <li><p><strong>Release Management Overview</strong>: Clear prioritization of bugs that need dealing with first, and bugs that require fixing before release, or fixes that need placing into the release branch are clearly marked and tracked.</p></li>
                            <li><p>People <strong>know where to find bugs</strong> to work on (one JIRA filter that everyone uses).</p></li>
