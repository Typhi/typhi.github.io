    <h3>Different types of estimations</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>No estimations</li>
        <li>Time estimations</li>
        <li>Complexity estimations</li>
        <li>Task counting</li>
        <li>Just comparing bigger items to historical bigger items (requires history + flexibility + trust + high prioritization)</li>
        <li>#noestimates</li>
    </ol>
    <br />

    <p>"Flexibility" mentioned in step 4 above:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Flexible amount of time allocated on roadmap
        </li>
        <li>
            Flexibility to cut scope if needed
        </li>
        <li>
            Flexible amount of resources to allocate to it
        </li>
        <li>
            Flexible finish date (for some topics)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Prioritized working: A semi-unrealistic but ideal situation is that you know what is most important, so you work on that next until it is done, then you work on the next most important thing until it is done, etc. In this scenario all you needed to know was the prio, not how long it would take.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately how long something will take is often of relevance to the prio, and it’s helpful to have time guiderails etc.</p>

    <h3>General notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Transitioning to the next step of estimation makes the previous one look like crap
        </li>
        <li>
            Teams going through steps 1 → 2 → 3 is a very very common pattern
        </li>
        <li>
            Timeline issues / low trust from management tends to force you in the direction of 2 (which increases costs)
        </li>
        <li>
            Concepts and terms it is helpful to be familiar with:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Burndown chart
                </li>
                <li>
                    Velocity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Scrum
                </li>
                <li>
                    Kanban
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a class="external-link" href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" rel="nofollow">Agile manifesto</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    #NoEstimates
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Some estimation traps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            They can trick you into thinking things are safe and certain
        </li>
        <li>
            Performance theater: Lots of talk about velocity and performance but little value being added by these discussions
        </li>
        <li>
            Cost: It's expensive to be precise, and things would get more precise by themselves when you're working on them anyway
        </li>
    </ul>
