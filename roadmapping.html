                            <li><p><em>Should</em> take: A lot of stuff on the roadmap comes down to this, actually. If we know an impact only makes business sense if it can be done within a certain time, then that's the time we'll schedule for it. If it's actually a lot more complicated then perhaps it doesn't make much business sense to do it, and we could be doing something more valuable with our time. This should of course also be re-evaluated when other thoughts and new information comes in.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Will</em> take: This is for the case when you've got something you know you <em>need</em> to do, and also know roughly how much time it will take. A lot of stuff on the roadmap is actually a mix of <em>will</em> and <em>should</em>.</p></li>
                            <li><p><em>Can</em> take: The amount of time we can dedicate to something before something else becomes more urgent. This is something that you will most often see pop up towards the end of sprints or quarters when the next big stuff isn't quite ready yet.</p></li>
