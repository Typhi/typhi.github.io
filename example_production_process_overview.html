    <h1>An Epic's Lifecycle</h1>
    <p>We break our milestones into collections of Epics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Epics are completable batches of work assigned to a production phase. We can use Epics in many places of JIRA to get an easy overview of work remaining.</li>
        <li>When far away in time, Epics are undefined and vague. They become more defined the closer we get to working on them.</li>
    </ul>

                        <p>Using high-level concepts and mockups, we break down the epic into actionable stories and tasks. Sometimes that's the full development team, sometimes a small group.</p>

    <h3>Maintenance</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The roadmap is expected to constantly shift and adjust, as we discover new information. Far away tasks become more clear the closer we get.</li>
        <li>The lead round discusses the roadmap semi-frequently to ensure alignment across the team and process any new information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Determining timeline</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The <strong>timeline for each production phase</strong> is partially based on the stage gate requirements (and thereby adjusting scope as necessary) and partially on summing up the amount of time we allocate for individual epics.</li>
        <li>Timeline for <strong>individual epics</strong> is set based partially on: semi-experienced guesses, historical precedent, and timeboxing to what we think an acceptable amount of effort to spend on a feature would be. Because each epic has a goal it is trying to hit, and there are many ways of achieving goals, scope is heavily flexible, which helps these time allocations work out well enough for our purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sprints</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sprints have their rough scope set based on roadmap.</li>
        <li>We sanity check and align rough expectations with the team during the planning as needed. </li>
        <li>No need for large discussion since we're not currently explicitly holding the devs accountable for not reaching it.</li>
        <li>We're running a sort of kanban with a sprint cadence added on top to use as a tool for aligning with the full team and externals.</li>
        <li>Note: Artists can have their own board with a slightly different approach.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Some sprint preparation notes</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>For preparing a sprint planning meeting, you’ll need to answer a bunch of questions for yourself. We won’t go into detail on those now, but some examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What does the Roadmap say we should be doing?</li>
                <li>What is ready to be worked on?</li>
                <li>What will each component do more specifically?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use epic-swimlanes on the board to set priorities on a larger scale, and drag tickets around within those swimlanes or on the milestone page to set relative priorities within each topic.</li>
        <li>
            <p>"Idea" status</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All "stories" start as "ideas", which is the status that represents when it's not yet decided if we should do the story and also don't have an estimation</li>
                <li>This can be used to get a quick view of whether a story is good to go yet or not. A ticket should only go to "open" when it's clear that we want to work on it.</li>
                <li>Various filters exist on the planning board for getting a handle on this.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Working through an Epic</h1>
    <img src="attachments/19103788/20742161.png?width=300" alt="JIRA Software Kanban Board" />

    <h3>Workflows</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sprint Board shows us the stuff we should be working on, and it's ordered by priority top to bottom</li>
        <li>For knowing what to work on: right to left (better to finish things than start new things), then top to bottom</li>
        <li>
            <p>Tickets move to completion from left to right, and if you’re working on a ticket, you’re responsible for taking it through the entire lifecycle. The end is when the work is done, which means the ticket is closed and the branch has been merged.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meaning: you're responsible for testing, for getting your code reviewed (when needed), and for setting up your demos.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Sometimes there might be more than 1 person working on a story, but we might not necessarily see that from the assignee field. That's fine, we might hear about it in standup, but also might not. What's important: the stories are making their way across the board.</li>
        <li>The board contains all tickets relevant for this sprint, and filters are used to see tickets meeting specific criteria (e.g. I’m a BE dev and want to see BE tickets)</li>

    <h1>Bugs</h1>
    <p>Bugs partially need special handling.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If a bug is in an ongoing epic, it goes into that epic and gets handled there.</li>
        <li>If there’s a bug in previously released things, how urgently it gets handled depends on its severity, and we keep bugs within self-set bug limits per priority.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Misc</h2>
    <h3>General notes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Why" is the most important part of a ticket. If you know <em>why</em>, you can theoretically do the ticket and achieve the goals without knowing the rest, if we're all aligned enough. It is easy to do stuff that doesn't actually accomplish something valuable, and knowing "why" raises the chances of that not happening.</li>
        <li>Talk to people, talking is good. None of this is a one-man show so it's a worrying sign when there's NO conversations going on.</li>
        <li>Please make sure there's always tickets for what you're working on, it's good to have things written down in the moment that you're working on it (lots of seemingly useful or clear ideas don't survive being put on paper. It's easy to hand-wave away important information in a verbal conversation), they're helpful when a week from now no one knows what we did anymore, and they're a communication tool.</li>
        <li>Good tickets are usually small (&lt;2 days). A big ticket is <em>probably</em> a bad ticket.</li>
        <li>See also: <a href="https://typhi.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IPS/pages/65645/General+thoughts+on+estimations">General thoughts on estimations</a> REPLACE ME</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>JIRA</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>JIRA should ideally represent our workflow to the point that looking at a ticket's transition buttons or a JIRA board can show you what you need to do from here.</li>
        <li>Example boards: Sprint Board, Asset Production Board, Epics board</li>
    </ul>
