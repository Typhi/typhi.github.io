    <strong>Thoughts on dividing into sub-teams</strong>
    <hr>

<main>
    <p>Context: My contribution to a discussion in a Game Production community</p>

    <p />
    <h3>Separate pods</h3>
    <p>Yeah, I‚Äôve worked in monolithic teams, sub-divided teams, and have transitioned teams from the one to the other.</p>
    <p />
    <p>Here are some general thoughts on the topic. I tried to keep it general and short since I‚Äôm limited to mobile for a while üòÖ, but I‚Äôd be happy to dive deeper into individual topics or provide examples as desired.</p>
    <p />
    <p>Typically, the topic of dividing a development team up into separated working units comes up when the team is getting too large to handle as a single unit. In my experience, this tends to start getting discussed around a total game team size of 15-20, but your mileage _will_ vary depending on the general setup and nature of the work.</p>
    <p />

    <h3>Pros of dividing up teams into discrete units</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>It‚Äôs easier to create/maintain valuable working relationships in smaller groups</p></li>
        <li><p>Increases efficiency in some areas: e.g. less people in meetings tends to mean more efficient meetings. Another example: it‚Äôs a convenient structure to silo information so that not everyone (needs to) stay up to date with everything</p></li>
        <li><p>Increased individual responsibility and transparency</p></li>
        <li><p>It provides a framework to use for scaling the team up further</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p />

    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Dividing work by topic area can mean overall priorities are getting addressed less efficiently. Example: imagine we‚Äôve got two topic areas: A and B. Now imagine the priority list by topic looks like this: AABBAA. The team focusing on B will in this example start work on the 3rd most important thing instead of the 2nd.</p></li>
        <li><p>It‚Äôs more difficult for people to have an overview of everything, and this easily leads to all sorts of fun inefficiencies</p></li>
        <li><p>You get some extra overhead to try to mitigate the above. This can take the form of an extra set of sync meetings between pod leaders. Example setup: add an extra daily standup meeting for pod leaders, add a larger pod leader sync per week (potentially just added on to an existing leadership sync), potentially additional syncs on a discipline level (e.g. all server devs get together to talk about ongoing server dev work)</p></li>
        <li><p>You have less flexibility to scale up attention on specific topics if the groups are fixed. Example: If important topic A is suddenly behind schedule, it‚Äôs now harder for various reasons to pull help from the people working on topic B since that‚Äôs _a separate team_.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p />

    <h3>Things to watch out for when transitioning to a divided team setup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Alignment becomes harder to establish and maintain, and subgroups can therefore start pulling in different directions</p></li>
        <li><p>You need to make some decisions about what level of cross-pod knowledge exchange you want to see. Part of the benefit of the split is reducing required communication, but you probably don‚Äôt want to go all the way to 0 either.</p></li>
        <li><p>Human tribalism and unhealthy competition/vibes between pods is a thing that can sprout up over time</p></li>
        <li><p>People don‚Äôt always like being boxed into specific topics! üòÑ</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p />

    <h3>My personal preference:</h3>
    <p>Because of the cons, in a growing team I like delaying dividing the team as long as reasonable.</p>
    <p />
    <p>When it becomes too unwieldy, I then first prefer to go for a _flexible_ division where pod leaders swap team members around frequently depending on the topics they have coming their way. This IS a little ~fancy though and may be too much complexity for some situations.</p>
    <p />
    <p>Eventually a growing team‚Äôs scale kinda seems to end up forcing a more static division though.</p>
