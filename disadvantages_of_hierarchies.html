    <h2>1. Decisions move upwards</h2>
    <p><strong>It's desirable to have decisions made as far down as possible</strong>: people doing the work generally have the most information about the thing they're working on, because they've put the most thought into it, and potentially have domain knowledge, so they're the most qualified, and will make the best decisions.</p>
    <p>There are many decisions being made every day by the people on the lowest level of hierarchy, and they're all made by the person who has the most context for these decisions. It's not feasible to pass these upwards, and practically they don't get passed up.</p>
    <p>(If we're finding that people on the lowest level of hierarchy are not making the best decisions about their domain, we need to find a way of better supporting their decision-making, like more context about how their work influences the results of the whole.)</p>

    <p><strong>Decisions can undesirably move upwards in hierarchies:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Each level of hierarchy has a feeling of responsibility towards a decision, so each level of hierarchy increases chances of someone in the hierarchy wanting to step in and pull upwards a decision they might not be qualified for</li>
        <li>Each level of hierarchy increases chances of passing on a decision upwards, because there must be some reason for the existence of the hierarchy</li>
    </ul>

    <hr />

    <h2>2. Information gaps creep in</h2>
    <p>Some decisions will inevitably end up getting made higher up the hierarchy. Some of those decisions even SHOULD be made further up the hierarchy. However, information gaps can easily occur when there are multiple layers. Which sucks, because when you make a decision about something, you want to have as much relevant information as possible.</p>

    <h3>Information transfer</h3>
    <p>There are various ways of acquiring information, as soon as you go past the single layer stage:</p>

    <div>
        <table>
            <colgroup>
                <col style="width: 226.67px;" />
                <col style="width: 226.67px;" />
                <col style="width: 226.67px;" />
            </colgroup>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Parties involved</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                    <th>Ways of acquiring information</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Single person</td>
                    <td>Instant information transfer</td>
                    <td>All inside of someone's head, hard to describe</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Two layers</td>
                    <td>Two-way communication, relatively easy</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reports with some context</li>
                            <li>One-to-one contact, including all the non-verbal cues of communication</li>
                            <li>Non-official communication that builds up from rapport and trust, that wouldn't go into a report</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Three layers</td>
                    <td>One middle layer responsible for making sure the top layer gets information from bottom layer</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reports, but context is less understood</li>
                            <li>One-to-one contact, including all the non-verbal cues of communication → significantly weakened, because there's an additional layer in-between</li>
                            <li>Non-official communication that builds up from rapport and trust, that wouldn't go into a report → significantly weakened - replaced by rumors and vibes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Four layers</td>
                    <td>TWO middle layers responsible for making sure top layer gets information from bottom layer.</td>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reports, but context is even less understood</li>
                            <li>One-to-one contact, including all the non-verbal cues of communication → all the non-verbal and emotional cues will now be lost at some stage with the multiple layers</li>
                            <li>Non-official communication that builds up from rapport and trust, that wouldn't go into a report → high likelihood that these do not get reported all the way up the chain</li>
                        </ul>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>Each level of hierarchy greatly decreases the information-gathering efficiency. This can be fine if we don't intend to make decisions at the highest layer. If we DO intend for that to happen, serious measures need to be put in place to make those decisions as well-informed as the decisions would have been with less layers.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2>3. Additional overhead and decision-makers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Each layer of hierarchy and reporting adds another layer of stakeholders, which adds additional decision-making stakeholder management effort</li>
        <li>More decision-making stakeholders doesn't necessarily make something better, and can result in a disjointed end result</li>
        <li>Opportunity cost of decision-making delays due to passing up the hierarchy</li>
        <li>Responsibility becomes unclear, which also makes the process of retroactively figuring out or debugging a decision-making process much more difficult</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All this takes time away from working on things that actually matter for the end-user / product.</p>
