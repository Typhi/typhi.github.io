    <strong>Trust-building interactions with stakeholders</strong>
    <hr>
</header>
<main>
    <h3>Proactively inform stakeholders about things they could be interested in, not just standard-cycle reporting stuff.</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Especially about risks and problems</li>
        <li>Also make sure to include cool/fun things they might like</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This builds trust by reassuring them that they're not missing anything and won't be caught unawares. They are in some way connected to our success, so if we unexpectedly do poorly it hurts them too.</p>

    <strong>Additional related points:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Also don't forget to inform them about <em>things they can do to make your life easier and more efficient</em>! Not only is this to everyone's benefit, it can also actually increase trust by demonstrating that you're spending time thinking about how you can better work together.</li>
        <li>Same goes for <em>reaching out to your stakeholders for input</em> in a timely manner. Reflect on which areas of your project the stakeholder input would add value, and ensure that is represented in how you approach your work. Build the confidence in your stakeholders that you will reach out to them on the topics that are important.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Include a plan of action or decision when you report problems.</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Example: "We're behind forecasted revenues" → "We're behind on forecasted revenues, we'll probably do A and B to resolve it, and we're also looking into other solutions."</li>
        <li>Example: "This is broken" → "This is broken and we're working on fixing it with highest priority."</li>
        <li>Example: "This is broken" → "This is broken but we're ignoring it until [future point in time] because we are currently focusing on [this other thing]."</li>
        <li>Example: "This failed" → "This failed, but we're OK with that because X, and will move on to something else."</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ensure everyone is aware of what is still work in progress</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It's hard for stakeholders to know what is final and what is not, and for them to know when their feedback is useful or not.</li>
        <li>If they see unfinished stuff with the assumption that it's finished, it reflects badly on you and the rest of the team, which can be unnecessarily unproductive.</li>
        <li>If you're showing something that isn't finished yet, ensure the unfinished parts are clearly communicated, and include information about what is still going to change in what way, so that they don’t fill that space with whatever their imagination comes up with.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Communicate about the elements of features/work that Management is interested in</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Value</em>: Is the thing that is being worked on generally valuable?</li>
        <li><em>Value for time</em>: Is the time being spent on this thing in relation with the value and what value we could gain from something else by investing that time?</li>
        <li><em>Quality of execution</em>: Is the thing going to cause problems unrelated to the value?</li>
        <li><em>Awareness</em> in the team of all 3 of the above</li>
    </ul>

    <p>A feature lacking in a few of those areas can be salvaged by making up for it in some of the other areas. Examples:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>a feature that doesn't sufficiently communicate its <em>value</em> to management could still be acceptable as long as the amount of <em>time</em> being spent on it is low (since it wouldn’t be high priority for them to discuss it with you).</li>
        <li>Poor <em>quality of execution</em> can be forgiven if the <em>value</em> is high enough.</li>
        <li>a feature that fails to convince management in <em>value</em>, <em>value for time</em>, and <em>quality of execution</em> is potentially still fine as long as management can rest easy knowing the team is or will be <em>aware</em> of it (e.g., "don't worry, we're A/B testing it").</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Focus communication around reasoning, not around execution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Execution should be a result of reasoning.</li>
        <li>If the reasoning is bad, the execution will result in sub-optimal results.</li>
        <li>Discussion about execution can easily end up in ineffective discussions because people's reasoning might be different.</li>
        <li>Stakeholders often don't (need to) know the details of a good execution, but you can have very productive discussions about reasoning, because that's the part that's important for fitting into an overall plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Be transparent with what happens with stakeholder feedback</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify misalignment.</li>
        <li>Reassure stakeholders that their feedback is being considered.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>(Note: considering feedback doesn't mean executing on it. This can often be a problem in the communication between team & stakeholders. Usually that results in repeated feedback about the same thing. Possible solution: "We have considered doing XY as you suggested, but due to ABC it makes sense not to do it.").</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Requesting trust or ownership is ineffective; instead, <em>demonstrate</em> ownership</h3>
    <p>Simply requesting ownership or trust doesn't change the trust levels, which is the underlying issue. Show that giving trust is the cheaper and superior option and that micro-involvements are not necessary! This can be done by (for example) practicing the interactions from this page.</p>
