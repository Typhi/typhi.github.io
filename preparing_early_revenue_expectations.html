    <strong>How to: preparing early revenue expectations</strong>
    <hr>

<main>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        It's helpful in a variety of ways to have expectations for a feature in advance.
        (See: <a href="why_prepare_targets.html">Why prepare targets / measure impact for changes?</a>)
    </p>
    <p>
        This is especially the case when it comes to <strong>prioritizing features against each other for roadmap time</strong>,
        and to make sure we're <strong>living up to the historical revenue potential of changes</strong>.
        Unfortunately, at this stage of the process, the design consists of a few bullet points.
    </p>

    <h4>Accuracy goal</h4>
    <p>
        The emphasis in the calculations done at this stage should lie on figuring out the potential that a certain feature represents.
        Our accuracy requirements at this stage are not very high, and it is not worth the effort of trying to get highly accurate (within 10ks),
        since that would require design when we aren't even sure if we want to do a feature yet.
        This number is not going onto our more precise 3-month forecasts, but is instead going to be used for calculating relative priority
        from a pool of possible changes we could pursue.
    </p>
    <p>It is important to keep this built-in inaccuracy in mind when comparing the results of these calculations later.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <em>Large differences matter:</em> Feature A has a potential of 700k over the next year,
                and Feature B has a potential of 100k. <em>Conclusion</em>: All else being equal, priority goes to Feature A.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <em>Small differences do not:</em> Feature C has a potential of 350k, and Feature D has 360k.
                <em>Conclusion:</em> They're the same. It's too easy for very minor changes earlier in the calculation
                to lead to a non-existent difference in the end result.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's probably a good idea to observe the math guidelines about significant numbers.
        Don't reflect more significant numbers in the end result than exist in the least precise of the factors.
    </p>
    <p>Our aim is to have <strong>enough accuracy to see large differences in potential</strong> between features.</p>

    <h4>Value calculation</h4>
    <p>Expectations are projected for the 12 months after release</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>to make our different types of changes comparable (yearly events versus long-running features, for example)</p></li>
        <li><p>because we want our changes to pay off relatively quickly</p></li>
        <li><p>to reduce risk of projecting far into the future</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to finding the potential</h3>
    <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border: 1px white;">
        <colgroup>
            <col style="width: 33%;" />
            <col style="width: 33%;" />
            <col style="width: 33%;" />
        </colgroup>
        <tbody>
            <tr style="border: 1px white;">
                <th style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>Step</p></th>
                <th style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>Description</p></th>
                <th style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>Example: Daily Quests</p></th>
            </tr>
            <tr style="border: 1px white;">
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>1. Find a reference value</p></td>
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;">
                    <p>Modifying an existing feature? Skip to the next step</p>
                    <p>Finding potential for a brand new feature?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>A good starting value has some form of grounding in reality. Therefore, try to rely on existing performance data as much as possible.</p></li>
                        <li>
                            <p>You could try using a similar feature as a reference. "Similar" can for example mean it is similar in terms of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><p>mechanics (mystery chests?)</p></li>
                                <li><p>motivation for using it (acquiring exclusive content!)</p></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><p>No feature in your game? What about the impact of a similar feature on one of your other games?</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;">
                    <p>Try using questline events as a reference, because they're similar in both mechanics and motivation for spending.</p>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="border: 1px white;">
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>2. Make adjustments</p></td>
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;">
                    <p>These are adjustments made to the reference value you found based on assumptions about the feature that you're calculating potential for.</p>
                    <p>Some questions that might be helpful:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Can the effectiveness of the change be expressed as a (gut-feeling based) percentage of the reference value?</p></li>
                        <li><p>What effects on or by other features are there?</p></li>
                        <li><p>What did the last modifications to this feature do? What is the relative strength of the proposed modification versus the historical modification?</p></li>
                        <li><p>Was a similar change made to a different feature that is somehow comparable? (Example: the addition of a timer to induce urgency.)</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;">
                    <ul>
                        <li><p>Questline events monetisation comes from encouraging players through content more quickly than they would go through it otherwise, motivated by two things: exclusive content + sense of urgency.</p></li>
                        <li><p>We could perhaps achieve a small percentage of the uplift we get from questline events, but over a longer period. Perhaps 1/6th of the uplift.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Average uplift (without sales) from questline events is 23% over the event duration. Gives us ~4% from this.</p></li>
                        <li><p>Subtract 50% to exclude time when events are running, because of likely cannibalization effect.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr style="border: 1px white;">
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>3. Apply time-based projections as required</p></td>
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>See "Value calculation" above.</p></td>
                <td style="border: 1px white; padding: 8px;"><p>Apply ~4% uplift to monthly revenue of ~6m and get ~1.4m for a full year.</p></td>
