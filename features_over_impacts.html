<main>

    <p>Roadmaps are a useful tool for representing priorities and scheduling work, but we can sometimes end up chasing the roadmap deliverables (ticking off checklists until a feature is complete) instead of going after valuable impacts. We might then ship a feature meeting requirements but not achieving an impact, or make changes and move on to the next item without knowing whether the change was successful or not.</p>

    <p>There is value in hitting roadmap milestones and release dates, but this is secondary to our primary task of adding business value.</p>

    <h3 id="Problem:Featuresoverimpacts-Consequencesoffocusingtoomuchonfeaturesoverimpacts">Consequences of focusing too much on features over impacts</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Wasted time designing, building and releasing features that achieve little, or nothing, instead of adding value</li>
        <li>
            (Worthless) complication of the product which:
            <ul>
                <li>probable extra inefficiencies for future production</li>
                <li>makes it harder for users to get value out of your product</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Frustration for the team</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Problem:Featuresoverimpacts-Contributingfactors">Contributing factors</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Environment mainly incentivizes delivering at certain points, with little attention on results</li>
        <li>Limited time leads to rushed &quot;ticking off checkboxes&quot; in an attempt to &quot;finish&quot;</li>
        <li>Minimum Viable Products conceived as minimal <em>functional</em> products, instead of minimum <em>impactful</em> products</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="Problem:Featuresoverimpacts-Howwecantrytoavoidit">How we can try to avoid it</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Set clear goals about what problem is being addressed and how the solution being worked on will add business value → <a href="introducing_changes.html">Introducing changes (2016.11)</a>
            <ul>
                <li>Communicate this goal clearly and often to external stakeholders and team</li>
                <li>Check back on this goal frequently to evaluate if it is still the focus of the work being done. It can also happen that a new, more worthy goal has been discovered during design or development.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Put focus on measuring the results of change
        </li>
    </ul>
