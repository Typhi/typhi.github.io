                        <p>You are often reminded of how a friend could improve your experience when playing the game in the core gameplay, a friend is important to your gaming experience and you can rationalize inviting a friend as being of benefit for both parties.</p>
                        <p>This added benefit can also be clear to the friend being shared with, which improves the strength of the conversion.</p>
                        <p>It's important that the fact that someone is a "real life" friend can differentiate them from random other players, otherwise it's easier to just get the help from the existing player base and you won't go to the effort of inviting someone.</p>
                        <p>Player awareness of this multiplayer aspect can be important to address - they might need reminders from time to time and while we as the game dev team are very aware of how important cooperation is, new players might not be.</p>

                            <li>Weakened by blocks in place against cooperation on the same internet connection.</li>
                            <li>Weakened by only being able to do this very well in the first days after starting - afterwards, your friend will have fallen far behind. (Planned: give a village to a friend so they can join at a later point in the game)</li>
                            <li>Was strengthened greatly by the addition of being able to invite someone to nearby your location, so that the invited player would become more relevant for the inviter.</li>

                            <li>Weakened by it being hard to directly interact with other players beyond the town - you can't set up a private trade for example.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>There's a real-time multiplayer tactical fight feature called Adventures, but it's weak because of how it's irrelevant for the core gameplay.</p>

                            <li>Have players choose their goods deposits so that you can specialize in certain goods, adding a more intentional social-cooperation aspect to trading. You'll see guilds organizing their goods deposits and players coaching their friends to go for certain goods.</li>
                            <li>Some way for a player to help out another one in PVE</li>
                            <li>Players you invite to the game provide a significantly stronger version of polivate to each other than a random player would.</li>

                        <p>Differentiated from the one above because it can easily be a fleeting 1-time experience of no lasting impact for your experience of the game. It can also add hesitation on your part to send an invitation because of your selfish reasons for doing so and also introduce hesitation on the part of the friend who is possibly aware of your motivations.</p>
